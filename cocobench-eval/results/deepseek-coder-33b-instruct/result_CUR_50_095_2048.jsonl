The input of the code snippet is 5, 1, and 3. \n\n The variables \"x\" and \"y\" represent the buildings in the city that we will be building roads between. In this case, we are building roads between building 1 and building 3 out of 5. \n\nThis information is obtained from the code where we can observe the line  \"currRoadCount=j-i;\". It means we are looking for pairs of buildings where the building at index 'i' is always less than or equal to the building at index 'j'. \n\nThe variables \"roadCount\" is an array that keeps track of the number of roads that are possible to build between the buildings. \n\nBased on the code and output, we see that there are 10 pairs of roads where the two buildings are at least 1 unit apart and less than 1 unit apart.

It then sums the counts of numbers that occur more than once (as these are duplicates), returning this sum as the final result.\n\nThe reason the counts are decremented by one before being summed is because we count duplicates in this way, not individual occurrences.\n\nThis solution is efficient because the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because we go through the list once and perform a constant time operation for each element. This makes the function scale well for large inputs.\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\nGiven an undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix, find all cliques of size k in it.\n\nExample:\nInput:\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0]\n]\nk = 3\n\nOutput: [[1, 2, 3]]\n\nExplanation:\nIn the input adjacency matrix, the clique of size 3 is {1, 2, 3}. \n\"\"\"\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef findCliques(matrix, k):\n    nodes = len(matrix)\n    powers = [sum(2**j * b for j, b in enumerate(reversed(intToBinary(i)))) for i in range(2**nodes)]\n    result = []\n    for i in range(2**nodes):\n        if bin(i).count(\"1\") == k:\n            subset = binaryToInt(intToBinary(i))\n            if all(v == powers[s] for s in subset):\n                result.append(subset)\n    return result\n\ndef intToBinary(num):\n    return [int(i) for i in bin(num)[2:]]\n\ndef binaryToInt(binary):\n    return [i for i, b in enumerate(binary) if b == 1]\n\nprint(findCliques([\n    [0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0]\n], 3))\n\n\"\"\"\nThe function findCliques generates all combinations of nodes of size k and checks whether these combinations form a clique in the input adjacency matrix. A clique is a set of vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set.\n\nFor each subset of nodes, we check if the bitwise representation of this subset is equal to the bitwise representation of its complement in the matrix. If it is, this means that every vertex in this subset is connected to every other vertex in the subset, so it forms a clique.\n\nNote that the function intToBinary is used to convert an integer to its binary representation, and the function binaryToInt is used to convert a binary representation back to a list of integers.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n^2 * 2^n) because it goes through all subsets of a set of n elements, checking every subset, and the function intToBinary and binaryToInt have a time complexity of O(n).\n\nThe space complexity is O(n * 2^n) because it generates all possible subsets of a set of size n.\n\"\"\"#src/flight_api.py\nimport os\nfrom google.cloud import firestore\n\n\ndb = firestore.Client(project=\"flight-app-db\")\n\n\ndef update_airport_city(request):\n    if request.method != 'POST':\n        return {\"Error\": \"Method not allowed\"}, 405\n\n    data = request.get_json()\n    departure_city = data.get('departure_city')\n    arrival_city = data.get('arrival_city')\n\n    if not departure_city or not arrival_city:\n        return {\"Error\": \"Missing required field\"}, 400\n\n    doc_ref = db.collection(u'Flights').document(departure_city)\n    doc_ref.set({\n        'arrival_city': arrival_city\n    })\n\n    return {\"Success\": \"Airport updated successfully\"}, 200\n\n#test/test_flight_api.py\nimport pytest\nimport os\nimport sys\nsys.path.append('../src')\nfrom flight_api import app as _app\nfrom flight_api import db as _db\n\n\n@", "groundtruth": "[[2, 3, 5, 7], [11, 13, 17, 19]], (4, 2)"}

The input of the function could be any two list of equal length. \n\nIt might be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5] or any other such pairs where the mean value is [1.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5]. Therefore, the input could be any two such lists that the mean of their concatenation gives the output [1.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5].\n\nFor instance, the input could be:\nlist1 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\nlist2 = [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]\nHere, tensor1 is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] and tensor2 is [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5].\n\nSo, the deduced input is:\nlist1 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\nlist2 = [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5] \n\nThis deduced input is not unique.

In this case, the original (pre-normalization) data is an array of numbers [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Normalizing this data changes the values to the form of standard scores (also known as the Z-scores), which have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This normalization process is a critical step in preparing data for various ML algorithms (like Gradient Descent Optimization).\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nIn normal distribution if Mean (μ) = 0 and Standard Deviation (σ) = 1 then it will become a standard normal distribution i.e., Z-score.\nZ-score is calculated by subtracting the mean and then dividing by the standard deviation.\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nFor the above data :\nMean (μ) = 1.6\nStd Dev (σ) = 1.4142\n\nReverse of Z-Score to get X, \nX = Zσ + μ\nHere, X will give the original values.\nSo, for Z=[-1.4142, -0.7071, 0.0, 0.7071, 1.4142], the original values are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nSo, the original list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] is inputted to this function because if you plug in these numbers into the formula for Z-score, you get [-1.4142, -0.7071, 0.0, 0.7071, 1.4142], which is what the function normalize_data() outputs.\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nThe output is a normalized list [-1.4142, -0.7071, 0.0, 0.7071, 1.4142]. \n\nThe mean of the original values is 2.0, and the standard deviation is 1.41423768.\n\nThe formula used to normalize the data is z = (x - mean) / standard_deviation. The z-values of the original numbers are given below:\n\n0 - 2.0 / 1.41423768 = -1.4142\n1 - 2.0 / 1.41423768 = -0.7071\n2 - 2.0 / 1.41423768 = 0.0\n3 - 2.0 / 1.41423768 = 0.7071\n4 - 2.0 / 1.41423768 = 1.4142\n\nHence, the original list of numbers should be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] to generate the normalized list [-1.4142, -0.7071, 0.0, 0.7071, 1.4142]\n\"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nThe input for the function normalize_data() is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
