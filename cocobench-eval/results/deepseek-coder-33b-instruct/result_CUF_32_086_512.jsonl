{"task_id": "java/6", "content": "\n\n\nAnswer: 4\n\nThis Java code is designed to determine the maximum set size that can be formed from two given integer arrays, nums1 and nums2. The code uses three HashSet objects, set1, set2, and set3. Set1 contains unique elements from nums1, set2 contains unique elements from nums2, and set3 contains the common elements between the two arrays. \n\nThe code then calculates common, which is the number of common elements between set1 and set2. It then calculates the number of unique elements in each array by subtracting common from the sizes of set1 and set2, respectively. \n\nThe code calculates ans, which is the minimum of n/2 and the sum of unique elements from each array and common. Finally, ans is updated with the minimum of n and ans. The value of ans is returned as the output of the function. \n\nWhen the input nums1 is [1, 2, 1, 2] and nums2 is [1, 1, 1, 1], the output will be 4, as there are 4 unique elements (1, 2) in both arrays, and the common elements between the two arrays are 1.

We will iterate over the array and maintain a priority queue which keeps the elements with highest frequencies on top.
