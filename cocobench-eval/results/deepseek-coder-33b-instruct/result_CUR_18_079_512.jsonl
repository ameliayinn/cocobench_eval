The string input is \"abc\" and the integer input is 2. The function calculates the minimum number of deletions required from the string to obtain k identical characters. The function uses a vector cnt to count the frequency of each character in the string. It then sorts the vector in ascending order and iterates over it to find the minimum number of deletions required. The output is 2, which means that the minimum number of deletions required from the string \"abc\" to obtain 2 identical characters is 2.\n", "groundtruth": {"word": "dabdcbdcdcd", "k": 2}}

The value in the left child is always less than the value of its parent node, and the value in the right child is always greater than the value of its parent node. This property allows for efficient searching in the tree, as it halves the search space at each step.\n\nTo find the kth smallest element in a binary search tree, we can use an in-order traversal. During an in-order traversal, we first visit the left subtree, then the parent node, and finally the right subtree. \n\nTo find the kth smallest element, we can keep a counter as we perform the in-order traversal. When the counter equals k, we return the value of the node.\n\nThis approach works because in a binary search tree, the in-order traversal visits the nodes in ascending order. Therefore, the kth smallest element will be the kth node visited during the traversal.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\nclass Solution:\n    def kthSmallest(self, root: Node, k: int) -> int:\n        self.k = k\n        self.res = None\n        self.helper(root)\n        return self.res\n\n    def helper(self, root):\n        if root.left:\n            self.helper(root.left)\n        self.k -= 1\n        if self.k == 0:\n            self.res = root.val\n            return\n        if root.right:\n            self.helper(root.right)\n```\nIn this code, `kthSmallest` is the main function that initiates the", "groundtruth": [[3, 6, 1, 9, 3, 6], 4, 3, 9]}

I'm trying to build a multi page form with php. I want to get the data from the previous page and display it in the next page.\nI know I can do this using $_SESSION variables, but I was thinking there should be a simpler way to do this.\nIs there a way to do this without using session variables?\nQ: Is there a way to add an extra column to a pandas dataframe that represents the number of rows in the dataframe at a given time? I'm trying to add a column to a pandas dataframe that represents the number of rows in the dataframe at a given time. For example, if I have a dataframe df with columns A, B, C, and I add a column D that represents the number of rows in the dataframe at a given time, I'd like the first row to have D = 1, the second row to have D = 2, and so on. I've tried to use df.index but it seems to be the same as the index of the original dataframe. I've also tried to use df.iloc but I'm not sure how to use it to add a new column that represents the number of rows in the dataframe at a given time.\n\nA: df['D'] = range(1, len(df) + 1)\n\nQ: How to get the current user's username in Firebase Cloud Functions?
