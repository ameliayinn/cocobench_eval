The cost for writing \"Y\" is calculated as the sum of the counts of 0, 1, and 2 in the marked cells, minus the count of the current value, and the cost for the remaining cells is calculated as the sum of the counts of 0, 1, and 2 in the unmarked cells, minus the count of the current value.

Therefore, the shape of the transposed array will be (2, 2, 2, 1).\n\n3. The np.squeeze(transposed_arr) call will remove any singleton dimensions from the array.

If the array is sorted, the function returns true.\n\nFor the input array [3, 16, 8, 4, 2], the code performs the bubble sort based on the count of set bits.
