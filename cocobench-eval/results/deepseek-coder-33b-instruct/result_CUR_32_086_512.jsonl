Then it's adding a constant to each element of the square rooted tensor. Therefore, the output of the code snippet would be the constant added to the square root of each element of the tensor. If the constant is 8, then the output would be [9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0]. \n\nThe tensor is [1, 4, 9, 16] because the square root of the numbers 1, 4, 9, and 16 are themselves. The code snippet is adding a constant to these square roots to get the output. Since the constant is 8, the result is the square root of each number plus 8. Hence the output is [9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0].\n\nHere's a code snippet to verify the solution:\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef sqrt_and_add_constant(tensor, constant):\n    sqrt_tensor = tf.math.sqrt(tensor)\n    result = tf.add(sqrt_tensor, constant)\n    return result\n\ntensor = tf.constant([1, 4, 9, 16])\nconstant = 8\nprint(sqrt_and_add_constant(tensor, constant).numpy())  # Output: [9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0]\nConclusion:\nThe code snippet is taking a tensor of four elements and taking their square roots. Then it's adding a constant to each element of the square rooted tensor. Therefore, the output of the code snippet would be the constant added to the square root of each element of the tensor.
