The pairs are formed by choosing two integers, i and j, where i<j. The distance between two integers i and j is calculated as the absolute difference between them. The pairs that can be formed are those that fall in the range of x and y. For those that fall outside the range of x and y, the distance is calculated as the difference between j and i.\nFor example, if n=5, x=2, and y=4, the pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), and (3,5). Out of these pairs, (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), and (3,5) fall in the range of x and y.
