We then create a set unique_chars of characters that appear the maximum number of times in the string. We then start iterating from the end of the string and add each character that exists in the unique_chars set to the result string. We continue this process until the unique_chars set becomes empty. This will result in the last non-empty string that contains the characters that appear most frequently in the original string, but in reverse order. Finally, we reverse the result string and return it as the output.\n", "groundtruth": "ba"}
