They are similar because they are also basically array and can be used in the same context and most of the operations we can do on arrays are also valid for Tensors. The tensor class in PyTorch uses the tensor class to define these kinds of structures in PyTorch and provides many powerful features to work with tensor data structures.\n\nHere, the tensor is of type float32 and requires gradient. The loss here is computed as the sum of square of all the elements present in the tensor. The loss is then backpropagated to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the tensor values.
