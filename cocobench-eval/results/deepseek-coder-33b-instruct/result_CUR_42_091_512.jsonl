The priority of the elements in the queue is based on the element value in the array and their index.\nThis is achieved by overriding the compare method in the Comparator.\n\nIn the given input, the array is [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7] and the sliding window size k is 3.\n\nThe PriorityQueue pq is created with the custom comparator that prioritizes the elements based on their value and index.\nThen the array is traversed and for each window, the maximum element in the window is added to the answer array. The maximum element is retrieved from the queue using the peek method.\nThe maximum element is then removed from the queue if its index is less than or equal to the current window's starting index minus the window size k.

The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the string. However, we can make it more efficient by checking the characters one by one from left to right until we find a mismatch. If we find a mismatch, we return false immediately, instead of constructing the entire string and comparing it. This way, the time complexity would be reduced to O(1) if the first character of the string is different. If the first character is the same, the time complexity would be O(2) for the second character, O(3) for the third character, and so on. The overall time complexity would be the sum of these, which is O(n^2). Here's how we can modify the code to make it more efficient:\n\n```java\npublic boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {\n    int sIndex = 0, tIndex = 0;\n    while(sIndex < s.length() && tIndex < t.length()) {\n        if(s.charAt(sIndex) == t.charAt(tIndex)) {\n            sIndex++;\n        }\n        tIndex++;\n    }\n    return sIndex == s.length();\n}\n```\nThis modified code reduces the time complexity to O(n), where n is the length of the larger string. It's faster because it can return false as soon as", "groundtruth": {"word": "abcbabcd", "k": 2}}
