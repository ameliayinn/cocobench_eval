It seems like you know that `arr1 + arr2` is the same as `concatenated_arr`.\n\nComment: @Adirio What a ridiculous comment.  List comprehension has absolutely nothing to do with the question.\n\nAnswer: You could have used the fact that `concatenate` and `sort` return a new array that is the concatenation/sort of the input arrays.  To get the concatenation/sort of both `arr1` and `arr2`, you can just call them twice with no arguments.  And then you can just concatenate the three lists.\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef concatenate_sort_searchsorted(arr1, arr2, value):\n    return {\n        'sorted_array': arr1 + arr2,\n        'insert_index_for_value': sum([arr1.searchsorted(value), arr2.searchsorted(value)])\n    }\n\\end{code}\n\nNote that it doesn't matter if `value` is in either or both lists since we will still find the index of the smallest item greater than or equal to `value`.\n\nOf course, you could have just used the fact that `np.concatenate` returns a new array and just used the same method to concatenate the lists as you had with `arr1 + arr2`.\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef concatenate_sort_searchsorted(arr1, arr2, value):\n    return {\n        'sorted_array': concatenate((arr1, arr2)),\n        'insert_index_for_value': concatenate((arr1, arr2)).searchsorted(value)\n    }\n\\end{code}\n\nBut then you don't have to import numpy.  Of course, this means that you could use the list method `sort` and the list method `index` to do the same thing.  Here is one solution:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef concatenate_sort_searchsorted(arr1, arr2, value):\n    temp = arr1 + arr2\n    temp.sort()\n    return {\n        'sorted_array': temp,\n        'insert_index_for_value': temp.index(value) if value in temp else len(temp)\n    }\n\\end{code}\n\nIf you really wanted to use numpy, then you should have noticed that [`numpy.searchsorted`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.searchsorted.html#numpy.searchsorted) also takes `side='right'`, so you could just do `insert_index_for_value = concatenate((arr1, arr2)).searchsorted(value, side='right')`.  Or use the method mentioned above to take advantage of the fact that `arr1 + arr2` is the concatenation of the two lists.", "groundtruth": "{'sorted_array': [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7], 'insert_index_for_value': 4}"}
