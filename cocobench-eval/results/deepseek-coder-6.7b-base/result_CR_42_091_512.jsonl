This is known as a performance issue, since appending an element to a list in Python is an O(1) operation, which is O(n) for the `extend` method. It is a good idea to use the `append` method instead of the `extend` method, which is O(n).\n\n    The `if` condition should have an else block. The code will not execute the else block if `data` is None, which means that no data is found for the source. However, if there is no data, there is nothing to extend the `results` list with. In this case, the `else` block can be removed without any impact on the functionality of the code.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n    Security Issue:\n    The code is using the getpass module to get user input.

It should be indented with 4 spaces.\n\n    The correct code is as follows:\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n    Logical Error:\n    The `continue` statement is used with the `else` clause in the `if` statement. The `continue` statement will never be executed if the `else` clause is not executed. This is a logical error, since the `else` clause is executed when the `data` is not None.
