{"task_id": "python/18", "content": "Please give detailed explanations on the errors.\n\n# Error Type\n\n## 1. Performance Issue\n\nPerformance issues arise when a code is executed inefficiently, resulting in slow or unreliable execution.\n\nThe code that has a performance issue is the following:\n\n```python\nsorted_list = sorted(dict_list, key=lambda x: x[sort_key], reverse=False)\n```\n\nThis line of code uses a lambda function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key. The lambda function takes an item x as an argument and returns the value of the key sort_key for that item. The sorting algorithm used by the sorted function is not efficient, and can be improved by using a more efficient sorting algorithm such as quicksort or mergesort.\n\nTo correct this issue, you can replace the lambda function with a regular function that returns the value of the key sort_key for each item in the list, and use a more efficient sorting algorithm such as quicksort or mergesort.\n\n## 2. Security Issue\n\nSecurity issues arise when a code is not designed to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.\n\nThe code that has a security issue is the following:\n\n```python\npassword = getpass.getpass()\n```\n\nThis line of code uses the getpass module to prompt the user to enter their password. The getpass module is not recommended for security purposes, and should not be used in production environments.\n\nTo correct this issue, you can use a different method to prompt the user to enter their password, such as using the input function.\n\n## 3. Syntax Error\n\nSyntax errors arise when the code has incorrect syntax or structure.\n\nThe code that has a syntax error is the following:\n\n```python\nprint(a + b)\n```\n\nThis line of code attempts to print the sum of two variables a and b. However, there is no operator between a and b, and the + operator is not used to concatenate strings.\n\nTo correct this issue, you can replace the print statement with a print function that takes the sum of a and b as an argument, and replace the + operator with a plus sign to concatenate strings.\n\n## 4.
