I was thinking of using some property of the bit manipulation but couldn't find a way.

Explain the process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) includes several steps:1. Convolution: In this step, the input image is scanned across a series of small, learnable filters. These filters capture localized patterns in the image. The filter moves across the image, performing an elementwise multiplication and summing the results to produce a single value in an output map. This operation is known as a convolution. This process is performed for each filter in the filter bank.2. Non-linear transformation: After the convolution, the result is passed through a non-linear function (typically ReLU) which helps introduce nonlinearity into the model and allows the model to learn more complex patterns.3.
