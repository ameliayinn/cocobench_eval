What is the purpose of a Python class? Explain the concept of encapsulation and inheritance.\n<jupyter_code>\n\"\"\"\nA Python class is a blueprint for creating objects. It provides a means of bundling data and functionality together.\n\nEncapsulation is the concept of bundling data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit called a class. In Python, encapsulation is achieved by declaring all the variables and methods in a class as private. Only the class itself can access these variables and methods. This prevents unauthorized access and modification of these variables.\n\nInheritance is a mechanism by which one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another class. This is useful to reuse the fields and methods of an existing class and to extend them to create new classes. In Python, a class can inherit properties from multiple superclasses. The inherited class is a subclass of the superclasses, and the subclass can modify or extend the properties of the superclass.\n\"\"\"\n<jupyter_output>\n<empty_output>\n<jupyter_text>\n3. What is the concept of multiple inheritance?\n<jupyter_code>\n\"\"\"\nMultiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming languages where an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or class. In other words, a child class can inherit from multiple parent classes. This provides a way to extend the functionality of a class without modifying it.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\nclass Parent1:\n    def func1(self):\n        print(\"This function is in parent 1.\")\n\nclass Parent2:\n    def func2(self):\n", "groundtruth": [{"user_id": 1, "name": "John", "last_login": "2023-03-10 10:22:34"}, {"user_id": 2, "name": "Alice", "last_login": "2023-03-11 15:45:56"}, {"user_id": 3, "name": "Bob", "last_login": "2023-03-09 08:12:04"}, {"user_id": 4, "name": "Charlie", "last_login": "2023-03-12 19:34:45"}, {"user_id": 5, "name": "Diana", "last_login": "2023-03-10 17:05:23"}]}
