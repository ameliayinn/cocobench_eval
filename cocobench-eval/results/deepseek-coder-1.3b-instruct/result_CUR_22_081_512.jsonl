The robot fills the grid in a clockwise pattern starting from the center of the grid.

If the smallest number is not the middle number, then the numbers that are smaller than the smallest number are inserted at the end of the sorted array.\n\nHence, for the given input, the code snippet should insert all the numbers in the array to make it sorted.
