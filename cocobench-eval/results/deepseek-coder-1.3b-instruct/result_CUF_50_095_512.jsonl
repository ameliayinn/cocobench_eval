In the function `maxOperations`, we first define memoization lookup table with size of n*n, and all elements as -1.

This function calculates the score of three operations: score = nums[l] + nums[l+1], score = nums[r-1] + nums[r] and score = nums[l] + nums[r]. Then, it checks for each score if it's the same as the prev, if it is, it increments the operation count by 1 and continues the recursion using the new arguments. Otherwise, it continues with 0. The function is then used to calculate the maximum score and its corresponding indexes using the following code: `dp(nums[0]+nums[1], 2, n-1), dp(nums[n-2]+nums[n-1], 0, n-3), dp(nums[0]+nums[n-1], 1, n-2)`.\nThe output of the given code snippet would be:\n{'output': 3}\nHere, the result is 3, since the operation sequence would be: `(2, 3), (6, 4), (3, 1)`.\nI hope the code snippet provided is sufficient to provide an answer to the question.

However, the torch library does not have a function called 'std'. So, to calculate the standard deviation, we need to compute the variance which can be done using the formula: (sum of (x - mean)^2) / n \n\nSo, we will use the formula (x - mean)^2 which will get us the squared differences and then will calculate the mean of those squared differences using the equation: 1/n * sum of squared differences\n\nLet's calculate the mean of squared differences: (5 - 5.25)^2 + (15 - 5.25)^2 + (25 - 5.25)^2 + (35 - 5.25)^2 + (45 - 5.25)^2 = 37.75\n\nSubstitute in the formula we get: 1/5 * 37.75 = 15.527\n\nSubsequently, the standard deviation will be the square root of the variance, or 15.527, which is approximately 15.52715027.\n\nThe code then calculates the normalized values by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation: [(x - 5.25)/15.527 for x in data], thus giving us the result:\n[1.41421356, -0.70710678, -0.29289322, -1.29884876, -1.70710678]\n\nThis is your output.\n", "groundtruth": "[-1.4142, -0.7071, 0.0, 0.7071, 1.4142]"}
