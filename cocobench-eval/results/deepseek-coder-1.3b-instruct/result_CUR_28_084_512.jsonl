The goal is to find the minimum number of moves that would need to be made to mark all indices of a given array such that the number of moves made is less than or equal to a given limit. The array can be changed multiple times.\n\nThe function `earliestSecondToMarkIndices` takes two arguments: `nums` which is the array of integers, and `changeIndices` which is the array of indices that the array `nums` can be changed.\n\nThe code snippet attempts to implement a binary search algorithm to find the minimum number of moves that can be made to mark all indices. The binary search algorithm is then used to find the minimum number of moves that can be made to mark all indices.\n\nThe function `isPos` is a helper function that takes the number of moves, the array of integers, and the array of indices as inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether it's possible to mark all indices with the given number of moves.\n\nThe output of the function `earliestSecondToMarkIndices` is the minimum number of moves that can be made to mark all indices such that the number of moves is less than or equal to a given limit. If it's not possible to mark all indices with the given number of moves, the function returns -1.\n\nThe output of the code snippet is 6, which is the minimum number of moves that can be made to mark all indices such that the number of moves is less than or equal to 6.\n", "groundtruth": {"nums": [1, 3], "changeIndices": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}}
