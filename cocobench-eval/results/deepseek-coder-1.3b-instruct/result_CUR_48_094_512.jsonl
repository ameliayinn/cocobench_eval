This complex number array is the result of the fft2 operation on the input array. The `fftshift` operation shifts the spectrum such that the center of the spectrum is in the complex plane, and the magnitude spectrum is maximized. The `ifftshift` operation reverses the operation of `fftshift`, bringing the spectrum back to its original form. The `ifft2` operation is used to transform the complex shifted spectrum back to the spatial domain.

Higher salaries are assigned the 'A' score, lower salaries are assigned the 'C' score.
