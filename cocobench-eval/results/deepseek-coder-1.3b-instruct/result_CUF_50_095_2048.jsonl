The number of deletions would ideally be less than or equal to k. In case of a tie, the order of deletion does not matter.\n\nPotential cases to cover:\n1. If k characters are larger than the frequency of the characters in word, we could keep all characters as it is, then use k-2 deletions (as we have 'k' characters of top 'k' characters).\n2. If we have k less than 2 characters and all characters appear once, it means we can form the word with all characters if we delete all of them (as every character appears k times, we could just delete all).\n3. Another case is when k is the frequency of a character and the character is repeated (let's say it is 'a'). Then we would choose to delete 'k-1' occurrences of 'a', and leave 'k' occurrences of a non-repeated character in the word.\n\nLet's consider the input {'word': 'dabdcbdcdcd', 'k': 2}\n\nThe word is 'dabdcbdcdcd', and 'd' and 'c' both appears 3 times, but 'a' only appears 1 time. \n\nThe characters 'd' and 'c' will be deleted as it will be less than or equal to 'k'. 'a' will be kept, then we will delete 'k-1' (as there are only 2 remaining in the word and k=2) occurrences of 'a'.\n\nThis results in the word 'abdcbdcd', which is a word that can be made up of the top 'k' characters.

To solve this problem, we need to implement a Python script that takes a list of dictionary as input where each dictionary represents an employee's details including 'first_name' and 'last_name'.\n2.

Next, we need to apply the 'UPPER' function on the resulting string which has the name.\n4. Then, we calculate the length of this string using the 'LENGTH' function.\n5. To get all these three values for each employee, we are going to loop over each dictionary in the list, extract 'first_name' and 'last_name' for each employee and calculate the length and uppercase name using the 'LENGTH' and 'UPPER' functions respectively.\n6.
